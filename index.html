            <h2>General Information</h2>
            <p>Working out is an essential part of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Here are some key points to keep in mind:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Good Form:</strong> It's important to perform exercises with proper form to avoid injury and maximize results. Always focus on maintaining good posture and technique.</li>
                <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Eating a balanced diet that includes adequate protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats is crucial for fueling your workouts and supporting muscle recovery. Make sure to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day.</li>
                <li><strong>Rest and Recovery:</strong> Giving your body time to rest and recover is just as important as working out. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night and incorporate rest days into your workout routine to prevent burnout and promote muscle repair. Consider incorporating activities like yoga or meditation to reduce stress and improve overall well-being.</li>
                <li><strong>Setting Realistic Goals:</strong> Set achievable fitness goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). Whether you're aiming to lose weight, gain muscle, or improve endurance, having clear goals can help keep you motivated and track your progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Consistency is key when it comes to seeing results from your workouts. Establish a regular exercise routine that includes a variety of activities to keep things interesting and prevent boredom. Find activities you enjoy and make them a regular part of your schedule.</li>
